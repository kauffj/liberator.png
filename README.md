# liberator.png

Is this an image? Or is it a gun?

![This Is A Gun.png](https://spee.ch/@kauffj:f/thisisagun.png "This is a Gun")

With just a few lines of code, the above image can be converted back into the STL files for the Liberator, a 3D-printable gun created by Defense Distributed.

This project is meant to remind politicians, bureaucrats, and busy-bodies everywhere that attempting to restrict distribution of code is both pragmatically preposterous and a violation of free speech.

For bonus points, this file was also uploaded to [LBRY](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry), ensuring that a record of it persists via blockchain.
